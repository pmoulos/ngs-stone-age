# ngs-stone-age
Next Generation Sequencing data analysis scripts and tools from the NGS stone age!

## Summary
Data analysis tools and scripts from the NGS stone age! Some of them (e.g. my 
personal alignment wrappers) are more modern. Included also a wrapper script for
the construction of a local UCSC Genome Browser branch (maybe needs some updating).
The vast majority of scripts have extensive documentation and help.
